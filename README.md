**lvminance** is a web-based photo editor developed as a personal side project.

> **Note:** This repository is used exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. The main application source code is not hosted here.

## About This Project

This project was born out of curiosity to understand how photo editing applications work and whether they could be implemented portably through a web browser. lvminance is an experimental exploration into building a functional image editor that runs entirely in the browser, without requiring installation or complicated setup.
